                        <p>Hello World!  I was born in St. Paul, MN and grew up in Shoreview, MN.  In 2009, I graduated from Mounds View High School and went on to North Dakota State University (GO BISON!).  I graduated from NDSU in 2013 with a BS in Zoology.</p>
                        
                        <p>After graduation, I worked as a Zookeeper and Animal Trainer for a few years.  I have always had a passion for animals, and it was extremely fulfilling to be able to care for some of the world’s most fascinating and exotic creatures!  Although I soon realized that the zookeeper life was not what I wanted to do long-term, it was a rewarding experience that taught me the importance of time management, attention to detail, and teamwork.</p>
                        
                        <p>After leaving the zoo, I took a job as an Administrative Assistant in the Fleet Sales Department at a car dealership (talk about a complete 180!).  There I slowly worked into sales and eventually became a Fleet and Commercial Sales Consultant.  This position helped me to further my time management skills (I had many bids with strict deadlines to submit) and also helped me to improve my organizational skills.  It also gave me a glimpse of what office-life was like.</p>
                        
                        <p>Although I really enjoyed working in an office setting, I recognized that I did not have the right personality for sales.  This is what brought me to really start to think about what type of career would be right for me.  This is when I discovered coding!</p>
                        
                        <p>My husband originally introduced me to the world of coding.  One of his hobbies is working with C# to build games.  What I liked about coding was how structured it is, how there are set rules in place in each language.  What I LOVED about coding was how even though it is very structured, you can still be very creative with it!  I really enjoy starting from nothing and seeing something that you create come to life on the screen.</p>
                        
                        <p>Once I realized that coding/development was the career for me, I looked into furthering my knowledge and came across the University of Minnesota’s Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp.  I started in the Bootcamp’s full-time 12-week program in early September 2018, and I am excited to see what I will learn!  Please keep following my portfolio to see it mature!</p>
                        
                        <p>I currently live in Blaine, MN with my husband and our four cats (and two chinchillas!).  Outside of animals and coding, my hobbies include snowboarding, video games (Zelda is my fav!) and painting.</p>
